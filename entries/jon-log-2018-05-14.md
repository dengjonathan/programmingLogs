# Iterator/ Iterable

Goal: to be able to use standard JS operations like for/of loops and spread operators on objects that we create

## Iterable protocol
* store some data
* implement the `symbol.iterator` method (that is what all the JS errors of symbol.iterator were trying to tell me!!!!!!)
* `symbol.iterator` method returns a Iterator object which has a next method accessign the data
* The iterator object's next method will return a object that looks like this
```js
{
  next: Boolean,
  value: any,
}
```

This allows us to use JS built-in operators
