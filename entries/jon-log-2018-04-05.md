# Nand2Tetris

**Nand** A Nand gate returns the complement of an And. Returns true unless both inputs are also true

**Xor** Either x or y, but not both

**Equivalence** X and Y have to be the same boolean sign

**If y, then x** x | !y (either x or not y)

## Building other gates with the Nand primivite

**Not** Nand(a, a)

**True** Not(false)

**And** Not(Nand(a, b))

## Gate Logic

Separate Gate interface from implementation

A composite gate will have a simple interface, but can be internally made of multiple logic gates

**Note** The only reason Nand is the primitive gate is because it composes the Not and And gates.  It is useful to have a single
primitive building into the hardware that can be composed in other nontrivial ways to compose multiple bits, but there is no theorem that says Nand is THE one.

# Scala Type Classes

Seems like interfaces in TypeScript.  We define a class with no state and just methods that take generic types
i.e.
```scala
object Math {
  trait NumberLike[T] {
    def plus(x: T, y: T): T
    def divide(x: T, y: Int): T
    def minus(x: T, y: T): T
  }

  // default definitions of the class
  
}
```
