# Nand2Tetris

**Nand** A Nand gate returns the complement of an And. Returns true unless both inputs are also true

**Xor** Either x or y, but not both

**Equivalence** X and Y have to be the same boolean sign

**If y, then x** x | !y (either x or not y)

## Building other gates with the Nand primivite

**Not** Nand(a, a)

**True** Not(false)

**And** Not(Nand(a, b))

## Gate Logic

Separate Gate interface from implementation

A composite gate will have a simple interface, but can be internally made of multiple logic gates

**Note** The only reason Nand is the primitive gate is because it composes the Not and And gates.  It is useful to have a single
primitive building into the hardware that can be composed in other nontrivial ways to compose multiple bits, but there is no theorem that says Nand is THE one.

# Scala Type Classes

Seems like interfaces in TypeScript.  We define a class with no state and just methods that take generic types
i.e.
```scala
object Math {
  trait NumberLike[T] {
    def plus(x: T, y: T): T
    def divide(x: T, y: Int): T
    def minus(x: T, y: T): T
  }

  // default definitions of the class
  object NumberLike {
    // means these methods will be available for any Double, because the classes will automatically be converted??
    // qq: i still don't get this
    // the implicit keyword should make all these members available as long as in scope??
    implicit object NumberLikeDouble extends NumberLike[Double] {
      def plus(x: Double, y: Double): Double = x + y
      def divide(x: Double, y: Int): Double = x / y
      def minus(x: Double, y: Double): Double = x - y
    }
    implicit object NumberLikeInt extends NumberLike[Int] {
      def plus(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x + y
      def divide(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x / y
      def minus(x: Int, y: Int): Int = x - y
    }
  }
}
```

The takeaway is that Type classes are a way to allow users of your library to retroactively extend your classes with new functionality while still retainin gimportant type information.  Mostly should be used in library code.

# Scala Path Dependent types

Allows a way to encode some relationship between 2 classes at the type level using nested types

This way, we can encode certain info that would only be known at runtime into the compilation step.

We can create path dependent types by placing their class definitions within another class.  That means that class's type is bound to the **instance** of the parent type

```scala
class Franchise(name: String) {
  // the type of an instance of Character is bound the specific instance of Franchise that it's constructed with
  case class Character(name: String)
  def createFanFictionWith(
    lovestruck: Character,
    objectOfDesire: Character): (Character, Character) = (lovestruck, objectOfDesire)
}

val starTrek = new Franchise("Star Trek")
val starWars = new Franchise("Star Wars")

val quark = starTrek.Character("Quark")
val jadzia = starTrek.Character("Jadzia Dax")

// these types are starWars.Character, which is a different type than the starTrek characters above
val luke = starWars.Character("Luke Skywalker")
val yoda = starWars.Character("Yoda")

// trying to use characters for different franchises will cause a type error on compilation because the method was expecting a
// path dependent type
starTrek.createFanFictionWith(lovestruck = jadzia, objectOfDesire = luke)
```

# Using Path Type dependent types with abstract type members.
