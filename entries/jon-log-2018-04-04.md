I still think this for comprehension, at least for containers is a little bit of a confusing syntax
```scala
def prepareCappuccino(): Try[Cappuccino] = for {
  ground <- Try(grind("arabica beans"))
  water <- Try(heatWater(Water(25)))
  espresso <- Try(brew(ground, water))
  foam <- Try(frothMilk("milk"))
} yield combine(espresso, foam)
```

# Scala Concurrency

We want to do some tasks parallely, without blocking on things like network requests, I/O, database q

Node.js uses callbacks, but those have the problem of inversion of control/ unreadability (callback hell)

# Future type

Scala uses a container type `Future[T]`, which sounds like it is comoparable to a JS promise

* The Future will resolve to type T, but it may also contain an exceptiona well
* Future is write-once, once the Future is completed, the container is immutable and only provides an interface for reading the value
* `Promise` type is responsible for actually writing the value to the Future, which separates concerns

**NOTE** In Scala you can't define type aliases outside a class/ object/ trait

I've been playing around with Futures and I think I understand them kinda at a high level, but actually writing them is still kind of a pain.  In a way that's how I felt with JS promises at first, and it is good to have these alternate ways of looking at problems such as concurrency.
