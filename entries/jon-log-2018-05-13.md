One of the nice things about working on the Nand2Tetris project is that there are very few abstractions and the data is all immutable, which makes variables at every point rather easy to inspect.  The output of the pins can't be modified anywhere else but instead just can be mapped to new values.  Is this true in other computers?

## Symbols

Symbols are a new data type- limited objects that behave as primitives

Why: as a way to add new properties to the Object prototype without breaking existing APis.

i.e. if I add a new property called "foo" to the Object prototype

things like this will break:
```js
for (prop in obj) {
  console.log(prop) // if foo is enumerable will log it, which is not what we want
}
```

Prevent name collisions by libraries using the Object prototype that have already monkey patched properties onto it

create a symbol using factory
```js
const symbol = Symbol()
// or use Symbol.for for singleton for a specific key
Symbol.for('someKey')
```
