# Kleisli Arrows

My brother told me about this yesterday when he got home from work.

**Kleisli Arrow** a class that allows you to compose other functions which return container types like Lists, Options, Try, etc.

The problem is that Scala has this paradigm:
`def lookUpPossiblyNonExisitent(id: String): Option[String]`

This will return either Some[String] or None depending on if the field exists.  However, when trying to compose these functions together it's kinda annoying to always either be accessing their containers or flatmapping. Dealing with containers is `plumbing` and imperative and not function.  We wanna just do our shit in `porcelain` (sorry for this pun)

```scala
object Kleisli extends App {
  import scalaz._
  import Scalaz._
 
  // Some methods that take simple types and return higher-kinded types
  def str(x: Int): Option[String] = Some(x.toString)
  def toInt(x: String): Option[Int] = Some(x.toInt)
  def double(x: Int): Option[Double] = Some(x * 2)
 
  // Lets compose those functions Ye Olde Way
  // this uses a list comprehension to unwrap the value from the option before applying the function to it
  // but you have to plumbing the unwrapp for every step
  // and you would have to do it again if you wanted to
  // chain another step
  def oldSchool(i: Int) = 
    for (x <- str(i); 
    	 y <- toInt(x); 
    	 z <- double(y)) 
    yield z
 
  // Kleisli!
  // this converts the option to a kleisli object which seems to be able to use this k arrow method to directly apply the functions to the containerized value
  val funky = kleisli(str _) >=> (toInt _) >=> (double _)
 
  println(oldSchool(1)) // Some(2.0)
  println(funky(1))     // Some(2.0)
}
```

# Scala Either Type

Either is a monadic container type that supports two type params `Either[A, B]`

If Either contains a value of type A, then it is a Left, otherwise it contains an instance of B and it is a Right.

Popular use for error handling is to have the Left represent an eror case, while the right represents a success value.

## Why can't you use methods like map, flatMap, filter directly on an Either type

Try is success-biased, which means that we can specify methods like map, flatMap work only when the object with type Try is a Success container.

However, using Either, we are unbiased, so we have to use `LeftProjection` or `RightProjection` to state which is our assumption.

Be careful using collection methods with projections, because their map functions actually return an instance of `Either` not of the original projection

When chaining methods, you need to convert the Either back into a projection

## How to use Either

Either can be used to wrap expected errors (no need to handle but can sometime fail) For unexpected exceptions, it is preferred to use Try

Also when processing a collection, where processing some of the items might be problematic, but you don't want to throw an exception.

I.e.
```scala
// return a List with two different types that can be processed differently (a better abstraction for lists with multiple types)
val checkedBlacklist: List[Either[URL, Set[Citizen]]] =
  blacklist.map(resource =>
    if (resource.visitors.isEmpty) Left(resource.url)
    else Right(resource.visitors))

```
