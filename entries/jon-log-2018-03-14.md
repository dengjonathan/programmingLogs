*****************************************************************

Scala has this really interesting structure where a pure method and a property
can be called the same way at the call site (with or without parens)

Which if you think about it there should be no difference apparent to the client between
a field and a method.

i.e:

```scala
class A {
  def getFive() {
    5
  }
}

val a = new A()
a.getFive // 5
```

*TC39 Article about adding Array.prototype.flatten breaking old MooTools library*

Main issue is that should the JS spec take into account whether new behavior will
break existing websites?  Or should it push forward?

How does a regular dev have a voice on TC39?

*GraphQL*

Main improvement over traditional REST architecture is that you can combine
multiple pieces of data on the GraphQL server and combine them into one response
payload- so the whole process of putting pieces of data is all done on the server
versus on the client.

* You can also add arguments/ and aliases
* Reuse fragments of the query
* you can use operation name like a function name in JS and use for error logging

* NOTE: don't dynamically construct graphQL queries, instead statically generate
  them and then pass in variables for the dynamic params
