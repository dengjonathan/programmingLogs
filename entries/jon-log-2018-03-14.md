Scala has this really interesting structure where a pure method and a property
can be called the same way at the call site (with or without parens)

Which if you think about it there should be no difference apparent to the client between
a field and a method.

i.e:

```scala
class A {
  def getFive() {
    5
  }
}

val a = new A()
a.getFive // 5
```
