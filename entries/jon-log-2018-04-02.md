# Pattern matching in Scala

```scala
case class Player(name: String, score: Int)

def printMessage(player: Player) = player match {
  // this dynamically matches the type of `player`
  // then extracts it's parameters if it matches + the guard clause
  case Player(_, score) if score > 100000 => println("Get a job, dude!")
  case Player(name, _) => println("Hey " + name + ", nice to see you again!")
}
```

## other example of pattern matching with destructuring statement

```scala
// we extract the name param of the Player object
val Player(name, _) = currentPlayer()
doSomethingWithTheName(name)`
```

Be careful that expression extractors always evaluate to what you think they do.  I.e. you could throw an exception in a null pointer error.
