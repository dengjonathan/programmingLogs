# Pattern matching in Scala

```scala
case class Player(name: String, score: Int)

def printMessage(player: Player) = player match {
  // this dynamically matches the type of `player`
  // then extracts it's parameters if it matches + the guard clause
  case Player(_, score) if score > 100000 => println("Get a job, dude!")
  case Player(name, _) => println("Hey " + name + ", nice to see you again!")
}
```

## other example of pattern matching with destructuring statement

```scala
// we extract the name param of the Player object
val Player(name, _) = currentPlayer()
doSomethingWithTheName(name)`
```

Be careful that expression extractors always evaluate to what you think they do.  I.e. you could throw an exception in a null pointer error.

## example for comprehension
```scala
def gameResults(): Seq[(String, Int)] =
  ("Daniel", 3500) :: ("Melissa", 13000) :: ("John", 7000) :: Nil

// this for block will execute and only yield the items that match the last expression
def hallOfFame = for {
  result <- gameResults()
  (name, score) = result
  if (score > 5000)
} yield name
```

## Using pattern matching anonymous functions

A lot of times we don't need to have different cases- one use of pattern matching is to decompose a type that we already know at compile time

```scala
// this code, both the filter/ map only have once case but they
// are useful beause they allow us to destructure
def wordsWithoutOutliers(wordFrequencies: Seq[(String, Int)]): Seq[String] =
  wordFrequencies.filter {
    case (_, f) => f > 3 && f < 25
  } map {
    case (w, _) => w
  }
```

**NOTE** When pattern matching make sure at least one of your cases matches, otherwise this could lead to a match error at runtime

## Partial functions

Partial functions are a trait (i.e. interface) that can be implemented, where given a unary function, the class can check if the element of a sequence matches that class, and if so applies the callback.

I.e. allows you to filter and map in the same step

In most pattern matching lambdas you want it to cover all possible cases to prevent a runtime error, but the collect method of a sequence will check `isDefinedAt` before calling the partial function.  That way the partial function only has to handle some of the possible matches.

```scala
val pf: PartialFunction[(String, Int), String] = {
  case (word, freq) if freq > 3 && freq < 25 => word
}
```

When passed to collect, the above example will only call pf if the word is within the expected range.

This is a shortened syntax for actually extending the PartialFunction class with `apply` and `isDefinedAt` methods

```scala
val pf = new PartialFunction[(String, Int), String] {
  def apply(wordFrequency: (String, Int)) = wordFrequency match {
    case (word, freq) if freq > 3 && freq < 25 => word
  }
  def isDefinedAt(wordFrequency: (String, Int)) = wordFrequency match {
    case (word, freq) if freq > 3 && freq < 25 => true
    case _ => false
  }
}
```

this function can be used like so
`wordFrequencies.collect(pf)`

# Functional Scala principles

## Option type

Questions to answer: why is this better than null checking

Some possible ways to deal with trying to access null values
1. throw a NPE (i.e Java, JS)
2. null-safe operator (Scala, Groovy) i.e. object.foo?.bar?
3. Clojure treats nil value like an empty container that conforms to how you access it, but that could lead to weird errors that are hard to debug because it can bubble down the call stack

**How does Scala do it?**

Scala's philosopy is that many languages incorrectly return null from methods that return an optional value (i.e. Person.name if a person doesn't have a name)

Instead Scala gets rid of null values altogether and returns a generic class for a value that may be present or not `Option[A]`

Option seems to be the superclass for two different types:
1. `Some[A]`
2. `None`

If the value is present, Option[A] is an instance of Some[A], a container holding the value of type A
However, if the value is absent, Option is the `None` object

qq: is None a singleton, or separate instances everytime a method returns an optional value that doesn't exist?

qq: how does Scala implement anonymous functions that aren't class methods (lambdas)

The benefit is that clients of an object are forced by the compiler to deal with the possibility that a value might not be present (because of the type checking by the compiler)

to use option, you can either explicity use Some or None objects, or use the Option companion class that will return an instance of Some or None based if the param passed to it is null
