# Pattern matching in Scala

```scala
case class Player(name: String, score: Int)

def printMessage(player: Player) = player match {
  // this dynamically matches the type of `player`
  // then extracts it's parameters if it matches + the guard clause
  case Player(_, score) if score > 100000 => println("Get a job, dude!")
  case Player(name, _) => println("Hey " + name + ", nice to see you again!")
}
```

## other example of pattern matching with destructuring statement

```scala
// we extract the name param of the Player object
val Player(name, _) = currentPlayer()
doSomethingWithTheName(name)`
```

Be careful that expression extractors always evaluate to what you think they do.  I.e. you could throw an exception in a null pointer error.

## example for comprehension
```scala
def gameResults(): Seq[(String, Int)] =
  ("Daniel", 3500) :: ("Melissa", 13000) :: ("John", 7000) :: Nil

// this for block will execute and only yield the items that match the last expression
def hallOfFame = for {
  result <- gameResults()
  (name, score) = result
  if (score > 5000)
} yield name
```

## Using pattern matching anonymous functions

A lot of times we don't need to have different cases- one use of pattern matching is to decompose a type that we already know at compile time

```scala
def wordsWithoutOutliers(wordFrequencies: Seq[(String, Int)]): Seq[String] =
  wordFrequencies.filter { case (_, f) => f > 3 && f < 25 } map { case (w, _) => w }
```
