# Scala Extractors

Question to answer how does pattern matching work under the hood

**Extractor** a class method that extracts the parameters passed to an object when it was created, implemented as a class's unapply method

##NOTE
To grep for two words on the same line, just pipe one grep statement into another: 
`grep -ir "inheritance" ./entries | grep -i "prototype"`

```scala
val user: User = new PremiumUser("Daniel")
user match {
  // because FreeUser's unapply method expects a free user
  // the unapply method is never called
  case FreeUser(name) => "Hello " + name
  // because user is a PremiumUser, we call PremiumUser.unapply
  // with user as teh argument
  // which will return Some("Daniel")
  case PremiumUser(name) => "Welcome back, dear " + name
}
```

## Extracting multiple parameters
Extracting multiple parameters should return an Option[Tuple[...params]]

Example of using another objects extractor to test for a boolean

```scala
object premiumCandidate {
  def unapply(user: FreeUser): Boolean = user.upgradeProbability > 0.75
}

val user: User = new FreeUser("Daniel", 3000, 0.7d)
user match {
  case FreeUser(name, _, p) =>
    if (p > 0.75) name + ", what can we do for you today?" else "Hello " + name
  case PremiumUser(name, _) => "Welcome back, dear " + name
}
```
