# Scala Extractors

Question to answer how does pattern matching work under the hood

**Extractor** a class method that extracts the parameters passed to an object when it was created, implemented as a class's unapply method

##NOTE
To grep for two words on the same line, just pipe one grep statement into another: 
`grep -ir "inheritance" ./entries | grep -i "prototype"`

```scala
val user: User = new PremiumUser("Daniel")
user match {
  // because FreeUser's unapply method expects a free user
  // the unapply method is never called
  case FreeUser(name) => "Hello " + name
  // because user is a PremiumUser, we call PremiumUser.unapply
  // with user as teh argument
  // which will return Some("Daniel")
  case PremiumUser(name) => "Welcome back, dear " + name
}
```

## Extracting multiple parameters
Extracting multiple parameters should return an Option[Tuple[...params]]

Example of using another objects extractor to test for a boolean

```scala
object premiumCandidate {
  def unapply(user: FreeUser): Boolean = user.upgradeProbability > 0.75
}

val user: User = new FreeUser("Daniel", 2500, 0.8d)
user match {
  // this code will use the extractor from premiumCandidate
  // to test if a free user is above the threshold
  // i.e. for pattern matching, the extrators don't have to be 
  // part of the class
  // the @ operator binds the type of the user instance (FreeUser)
  // to the matched variable freeUser
  case freeUser @ premiumCandidate() => initiateSpamProgram(freeUser)
  case _ => sendRegularNewsletter(user)
}
```

**NOTE** Infix operators are operators placed between the operand, i.e. plus sign in `2 + 2`

# Case Classes

Like regular classes which have an `apply` method as their constructor, so you don't have to use the new keyword.  Equality of case classes is compared by structure, not by reference.

They are good for modelling immutabel data because of this equality checking/ and shallow copying.
