Every digital device is make of chips that use **logic gates** as their primitive building block.

# Boolean Gates

Boolean gates are physical implementations of Boolean functions, which can be interconnected to deliver more complex functionality

*qq**: it would be cool to explore the connection between Boolean formal logic and computer representation using radix 2 (is it just a coincidence or are they connected)

**Every Boolean function, no matter how complex can be composed of And, Or and Not**

We use Nand as our primitive logic gate, because And/ Or and Not can all be constructed from Nand alone- so we just need one type of physical device that can describe a Nand logic gate

But since Boolean algebra is indepednet of the actual physical devices that store and transmit binary data, software is not necessarily dependent on a certain hardware.  It is extremely portable and can be represented on any physical system with storage and switching.

This allows us to have separation of concerns between computer scientists (who can work on abstractions) versus actual hardware engineers

Because all gates take in binary numbers 0 or 1 and they all output 0 and 1 they can be chained together to create composite logic gates of *arbitrary* complexity

**Art of Gate Design** given a specification, match the interface as efficiently as possible in terms of time and resources

Hard to prove correctness formally with complex chips, must settle for empirical testing

# Multibit versions of logic gates

Computer hardware is designed to operate on multibit arrays called buses.  A 32 bit computer is called that because its And gate can take 2 32-bit buses as input

**The architecture of a n-bit logic gate should be the same irrespective of n's value**

qq: why do different versions of the OS have to be compiled to 32 and 64 bit computers
