Every digital device is make of chips that use **logic gates** as their primitive building block.

# Boolean Gates

Boolean gates are physical implementations of Boolean functions, which can be interconnected to deliver more complex functionality

*qq**: it would be cool to explore the connection between Boolean formal logic and computer representation using radix 2 (is it just a coincidence or are they connected)

**Every Boolean function, no matter how complex can be composed of And, Or and Not**

We use Nand as our primitive logic gate, because And/ Or and Not can all be constructed from Nand alone- so we just need one type of physical device that can describe a Nand logic gate
