# continue learning Scala

Scala has functions as well as methods, meaning, like JS, you can just call a function that is not related to a class
i.e.
`sqrt(2)`

Scala doesn't have static methods on classes but each class can have a related `companion object` which is a singleton whose methods act like the classes static methods
 - this seems to be similar to the prototype inheritance pattern of javascript
 - allows you to break up the classes static methods among different companion objects and compose their static methods

 Style rule: if a method call doesn't have parameters and doesn't mutate the object, you shouldn't put the parens: makes it easy to reason about.  Diff between pure function/ computed property should be transparent to user
