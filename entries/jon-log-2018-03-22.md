# continue learning Scala

Scala has functions as well as methods, meaning, like JS, you can just call a function that is not related to a class
i.e.
`sqrt(2)`

Scala doesn't have static methods on classes but each class can have a related `companion object` which is a singleton whose methods act like the classes static methods
 - this seems to be similar to the prototype inheritance pattern of javascript
 - allows you to break up the classes static methods among different companion objects and compose their static methods

 Style rule: if a method call doesn't have parameters and doesn't mutate the object, you shouldn't put the parens: makes it easy to reason about.  Diff between pure function/ computed property should be transparent to user

 Scala overloads the semantics of the parens by using it for access as well as method call
 i.e
 `"hello"(4)` returns char at index 4

 Scala uses `apply` method of a class for constructing new objects instead of the new keyword

 The Scala paradigm is to provide lots of methods for every conceivable use case

# Control Structures

 Scala paradigm, stay away from statements, every construct should have a value (i.e. should be an expression that evaluates to a value)
 i.e. 
 * if expression
 * block is the value of its last expression
 * void type is Unit
 * don't use return
 * use pattern matching for a catch flow

## If/ else
`val s = if (x > 0) "positive" else -1`
The type of this expr is the super type of both possible return types

**Unit** is similar to void, it expresses no useful value
`val s = if (x > 0) "positive"` will return an instance of Unit if x is less than 0

**Scala only needs semicolons to terminate a statement if it is not otherwise clear from context that the statement ended**

you can put multiple expressions in blocks to initialize a variable with more than one step
i.e.
```scala
val greeting = {
  val name = getNameFromAPI()
  val salutation = getSalutation(name)
  "hello" + name + salutation
}
```

**Note cannot use chained assignments in Scala, because assignments have a type of Unit**
```scala
// NO!
x = y - 1
```
