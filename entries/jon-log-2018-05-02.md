# [Hacker News article about cryptography](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/40/sherman.php)

The main takeway as that a cryptographer named William Friedman, who was the government's chief cryptographer in the years after WWII, learned that any piece of data, with the proper key, can symbolize any other piece of data.  This is a foundational realization for the computer age, where we compute on symbols that stand for real world concepts.

# Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

For this project our ALU takes in 2x 16 bit numbers, and can execute some fixed set of functions, and give a 16bit output

How to design an ALU: first design a spec for all the operations you want the chip to support, then work backwards and see what binary operations you need to support this chip

This gives you a unit with only the required functionality.

There is this tradeoff between implementing more operations in hardware (which has more cost and more performance) versus doing it in software.

# Signed Integers

For 2's complement signed integers, to represent negative numbers, we flip all the bits of the positive number, then increment by 1

```
# Represent -2

Positive 2: 0010
Positive 2's complement: 1101
Increment: 1110

# this is how -2 is represented in a 4 bit number
```

Why are signed integers represented like this?

* All positive numbers are 0, all negative numbers are 1
* Addition of any 2 signed ints is the same as the addition of positives (because they are complements, adding them together will cancel each other out)
* Main gain is that you can have easy bitwise addition without special hardware
