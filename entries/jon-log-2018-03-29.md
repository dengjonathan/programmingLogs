# grep practice

from [this](http://opensourceforu.com/2012/06/beginners-guide-gnu-grep-basics-regular-expressions/)

Grep stands for "Global Regular Expression Print"

* use -i flag for case insensitive
* -v: inverted search (search for lines not containing pattern)
* -r: recursive search
* -l or -L to find files with or without matches
* -A: print trailing lines for context
* -B: print leading lines for context

**$?** is a variable you can use in the CLI for the result of the last expression
