# grep practice

from [this](http://opensourceforu.com/2012/06/beginners-guide-gnu-grep-basics-regular-expressions/)

Grep stands for "Global Regular Expression Print"

* use -i flag for case insensitive
* -v: inverted search (search for lines not containing pattern)
* -r: recursive search
* -l or -L to find files with or without matches
* -A: print trailing lines for context
* -B: print leading lines for context
* -q: quite mode, just returns 0/1 depending if a match was found

* you can use `"` to get the shell to expand a variable
`grep "$HOME" /etc/passwd`

* you can get the shell to run other commands using backticks

```bash
grep `whoami` /etc/passwd
```

**$?** is a variable you can use in the CLI for the result of the last expression

# some RegExp stuff
// this stuff could have helped me on the Google interview

* `.` matches any single char
* `?` means that item is optional and will only be matched once // I still don't get this
* `*` means item matched 0 or more times
* `+` means item matched 1 or more times
* `{n}`means item must be matched exactly n times
*  `{m, n}` means item must be matched in this range number of times
* `^` negation fo the class

## anchor classes
* `$` pattern is at the end of the line
* `\<` pattern at start of word
* `\>` pattern at end of word
* `\b` word boundary (either beginning at the end of the word
* `|` either or operator
