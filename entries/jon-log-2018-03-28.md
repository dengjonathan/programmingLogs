Jon's Work Logs for Mar 28, 2018

# Scala arrays
* Use `Array` data structure if length is fixed, and `ArrayBuffer` if the lenght can vary
* Use () to access elements in an array
* A Scala Array is the same class as a Java Array


## Array
Declaring an array
`val nums = new Array[Int](10)`

Declaring an array using literal syntax (don't use `new`)
```scala
// this infers type Array[String](2)
val words = Array("hello", "world)
```

Access
`val hello = words(0)`

## ArrayBuffer
Like a JS array or Java ArrayList: grow + shrink on demand

```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
val b = new ArrayBuffer[Int] // don't need parens when no params

// add items to the array using += operator
b += 1

// add multiple
b += (2, 3, 4)

// append another collection
b ++= Array(2, 4)
```

// add/removing is amortized constant time operation
## Array Comprehensions

using yield for list comprehensions
```
val names = Array("jon", "tim")
// yields new collection without mutating original collection
val greetings = for (name <- names) yield "hello " + name
```

in a more functional world
`names map { "hello " + _ }`

# HashMaps

`val scores = Map("Alice" -> 10, "jon" -> 5, ("tim", 8))`
This syntax makes the key, value pair functionality of a map apparent
Scala will automatically infer types based on the pairs passed into the map

Think of Maps as a class with methods returning a value (even though the value isn't computed, just looked up in the map)

access:
`jonsScore = scores("jon")`

guarded access:
`scores.getOrElse("jon", 0)`

you can also get an Option object
`scores.get("jon") // Option[Some[string] | None]`

iterating over maps
`for ((k, v) <- map) // do something with k, v`

Use `scala.collection.immutable.SortedMap` to get a tree map with ordering between the keys


# Scala Classes

* Scala automatically creates getters/ setters for each property you declare in a class, you can override these if need
* you can use parameter-less method calls if you are just accessing

```scala
class Counter {
  private var value = 0
  def increment() { value += 1 }
  def current() = value + 1 // if we want to start at 1 for some reason

}

val counter = new Counter()
counter.increment()
counter.current
// or 
counter.current()
// shouldn't matter to the consumer
```

pattern for access for a private variable
```scala
class Person {
  _privateAge = 0

  def age = privateAge
  def age_= (newValue: Int) {
    // only allow to set ages greater than private age
    _privateAge = if (newValue > _privateAge) newValue else _privateAge
  }
}

val fred = new Person
fred.age // 0
fred.age = 24 // consumer uses age field in a transparent way to implementation
```

**Note**: in Scala, when you create a field, you are also implicitly creating the getter and/or setter

In Scala (as in Java), a method can access private fields of all objects of its class (i.e. a Counter class can access the private value field of all other instances of Counter)

You can add another layer of privacy by making a field `object-private`

```scala
private[this] var value = 0
```
This only allows methods of the same instance to access this private value, no getter and setter is generated in this case

**Uniform Access Principle** Client of a module should not know if a value is implemented through storage or computation, but instead should just access a module's services through a uniform notation

Scala seems to implement this by automatically generating getters and setters for each value in a class.  That way the client doesn't know whether the value was arrived had from storage or computation

## Primary constructor

Scala lets you define paramters for a class's primary constructor and you can add any number of auxiliary constructors
```scala
// this creates a person with with name and age
class Person(val name: String = "", val age: Int = 0) {

  // primare constructor executes all statements in the class definition
  // this will print
  println("constructed another person")

  auxiliary constructor
  def this(name: String) {
    // call primary constructor
    this()
    this.name = name
  }
}
```

## Nested Classes
In Scala you can nest just about anything in anything, so you can define classes within other classes

# Scala Packages

packages can be exported in a nested manner
```scala
package com {
  package horstmann {
    package impatient {
      class Employee
    }
  }
}
```
Importing com.horstman.impatient will pull in the class Employee

// within a package, everything in the parent package is in scope

in Scala package names are relative (unlike Java), but packages are open-ended and people can write new classes that cause namespace collisions

The preffered syntax is to put all package notations at the top of a file

```scala
package com.creditKarma.autos
package awesomeModule

// any classes in this file will be in com.CreditKarma.autos.awesomeModule
```

Limitation of the JVM is that you can't directly import functions or variables

To get around this you can use a package object
```scala
// this will be package.default
// the package object will be compiled to a JVM class with static methods/ fields inside the package
package object people {
  val default = "John Doe"
}
```

# Scala Inheritance

**fragile base class problem** if I implement a method in my super class that causes a collision with a sub classe's method

You can create anonymous subclasses that include a block of definitions and overrides
val alien = new Person("fred") {
  def greeting = "Greetings, my name is fred"
}

## dealing with super class constructors that call overrrideable methods

```scala
class Creature {
  val range: Int = 10
  // set env to an array with the length of range
  val env: Array[Int] = new Array[Int](range)
}

class Ant extends Creature {
  override val range = 2
  // this will create a problem by setting env to an array with length 0
}

// 1. the Ant class calls its superclass constructor
// 2. the Creature constructor tries to set it's `env` field, but calls the range method
// 3. because the range method is overridden but not initialized yet (that happens in the Ant constructor), the range method returns 0 (which is the default value for an integer field in an object)
// 4. env field is created with length 0
```

Ways to mitigate this:
1. set vals used in constructor to `final`, but this is inflexible
2. declare val as lazy in the superclass (inefficient)
3. use early definition syntax, which allows you to initialize val fields of a subclass before the superclass is initialized (seems kind of unsafe)

ex
```scala
class Bug extends {
  // set this val before calling Creature's constructor
  override val range = 3
} with Creature
```
